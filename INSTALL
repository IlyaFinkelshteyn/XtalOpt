This is a shortened version of the installation procedure. For
step-by-step instructions, see

http://xtalopt.openmolecules.net/wiki/index.fcgi/wiki/Installation

1. Requirements
===============
 -- CMake 2.6.0 or later 
 -- Qt 4.6.0 or later
 -- Avogadro cryos/master or dlonie/avogadro branch
 -- OpenBabel trunk svn branch
 -- Eigen 2.0.3 or later (2.0.9 recommended)
 -- At least one of the following local optimizers:
    -- GULP
    -- VASP
    -- PWscf


2. Dependencies
===============
XtalOpt has a few dependencies, some of which need development
versions.

2.1) cmake version >= 2.6.0

  cmake is a build system that is used by Avogadro, Openbabel, and
  XtalOpt. The optional ccmake package (sometimes included in with
  cmake) is worth installing to simplify package configuration. This
  can be found in any linux package manager.

2.2) Qt version >= 4.6.0

  Qt provides the user interface or XtalOpt and can be found in most
  linux package managers or from the TrollTech website:
  http://www.trolltech.com.
  Earlier versions (>= 4.5.0) may also work, but have not been tested.

2.3) Eigen version >= 2.0.3

  Eigen2 implements matrices and vectors in Avogadro and XtalOpt. It
  is also commonly available in most package managers, or can be
  downloaded from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org.

2.4) OpenBabel development version (trunk >= r3645)

  Openbabel is a chemical toolkit for C++ used heavily by both
  Avogadro and XtalOpt. While it is available on most linux
  distributions, XtalOpt *requires* the development version that can
  only be obtained through the sourceforge subversion
  repository. Complete installation instructions are available at
  http://openbabel.org/wiki/Subversion.

2.5) Avogadro development version (cryos or dlonie)

  Avogadro is the main application that XtalOpt extends. A development
  version is also *required*, and we recommend using the git
  repository at http://github.com/dlonie/avogadro, although the
  official "cryos" repository at http://github.com/cryos/avogadro
  should work as well. Complete installation instructions for Avogadro
  are found at
  http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/wiki/Compiling_on_Linux_and_Mac_OS_X.

2.6) Local optimizers

  XtalOpt needs one of the following external optimizers in order to
  perform the local optimization steps:

  -- GULP,   https://www.ivec.org/gulp/
  -- VASP,   http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/vasp.html
  -- PWscf,  http://www.quantum-espresso.org/

  Information on obtaining/installing each can be found on their
  respective websites.


3. Basic Installation
=====================
These instructions give a very basic overview of how to configure, compile and
install XtalOpt on most systems.  If you are using unique install locations
and/or libraries are not automatically detected please consult the 'Advanced'
section.

3.1) Create a 'build' directory in the package source directory.

   mkdir build
   cd build

3.2) Configure the build system

   cmake ../

   or,

   ccmake ../

3.3) Compile

   make -j2

3.4) Install

   sudo make install

After installing, XtalOpt will appear in Avogadro's "Extensions"
menu as "Crystal Optimization."


4. Advanced
===========
The build system (CMake) provides mechanisms for specifying non-standard
installation locations.

   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : specify the installation prefix
                            (default /usr/local)

   -DLIB_INSTALL_DIR : specify the install location for libraries
                       (default ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib)

   -DOPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES : specify the OpenBabel2 libraries

   -DOPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR : specify the OpenBabel2 include directory

   -DEIGEN2_INCLUDE_DIR : specify the Eigen include directory

For more information please consult the CMake documentation or the
Avogadro wiki.
